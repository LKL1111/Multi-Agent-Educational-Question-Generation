Question 3: What is the purpose of a forwarding table in a router?

Question 5: What is the purpose of the Initialization Vector (IV) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) technique?
Answer 5: The purpose of the Initialization Vector (IV) in the CBC technique is to provide a random k-bit string that is used to encrypt the first block of the message, and then the subsequent blocks are encrypted using the previous block's ciphertext and the IV, thereby ensuring that identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertext blocks.


=== Chapter 8 - Subchapter 2 ===
Question 1: What is the main difficulty with symmetric key encryption systems?
Answer 1: The main difficulty with symmetric key encryption systems is that the two communicating parties must somehow agree on the shared key, but to do so requires (presumably secure) communication.
Question 2: What is the purpose of the public key in public key cryptography?
Answer 2: The purpose of the public key in public key cryptography is to allow anyone to send an encrypted message to the recipient, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption.
Question 3: How does the RSA algorithm work?
Answer 3: The RSA algorithm works by using two large prime numbers, p and q, to generate the public and private keys. The public key is used for encryption and is a pair of numbers (n, e), while the private key is used for decryption and is a pair of numbers (n, d). The encryption and decryption algorithms use modular arithmetic to ensure that the original message is recovered.
Question 4: What is the purpose of a session key in RSA?
Answer 4: The purpose of a session key in RSA is to use a symmetric key cipher (e.g., with DES or AES) to encrypt a large amount of data, and the session key is encrypted using the recipient's public key.
Question 5: Why does RSA rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers?
Answer 5: RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers because if one knew the prime factors p and q, they could easily compute the secret key, d, given the public value e. Therefore, the security of RSA is based on the assumption that there are no known algorithms for quickly factoring a number.

Question 2: What is the main advantage of using HTTP streaming over UDP streaming?
Answer 2: HTTP streaming allows the video to traverse firewalls and NATs more easily and obviates the need for a media control server, reducing the cost of a large-scale deployment over the Internet.
Question 3: What is prefetching in the context of streaming stored video?
Answer 3: Prefetching is the process of downloading video at a rate higher than the consumption rate, thereby building up a reserve of video in the client application buffer.
Question 4: What happens to the client application buffer when the user pauses the video during streaming?
Answer 4: The client application buffer does not remove bits, and if it becomes full, it will cause back pressure all the way back to the server, potentially forcing the server to stop transmitting.
Question 5: What is the initial buffering delay in HTTP streaming, and how is it determined?
Answer 5: The initial buffering delay is the time required to build up Q bits in the application buffer, and it is determined by tp = Q/x, where x is the server send rate.
