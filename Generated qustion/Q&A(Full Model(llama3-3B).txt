Question Type: Application Questions
Question: Design a simple client-server network application using socket programming, where clients can send messages to a server and receive responses, and explain how the client-server architecture facilitates communication between the two, including how the application should handle errors and implement encryption to ensure secure communication.
Answer: "A simple client-server network application using socket programming involves the following steps:1.  The server creates a socket and binds it to a specific address and port.2.  The client creates a socket and connects to the server's address and port.3.  The client sends a message to the server through the socket.4.  The server receives the message and processes it.5.  The server sends a response back to the client through the socket.The client-server architecture facilitates communication between the two by allowing the server to host multiple clients and manage requests from each client. This architecture also enables the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously, making it suitable for high-traffic applications.To handle errors, the application can implement error checking and handling mechanisms, such as checking for invalid input or network errors. The application can also implement retry mechanisms to handle temporary network failures.To implement encryption, the application can use encryption algorithms, such as SSL/TLS, to secure the communication between the client and server. This can be achieved by using a certificate authority to establish trust between the client and server, and by implementing encryption protocols to secure the data being transmitted."

Question: How does the client-server architecture handle multiple requests from multiple clients in a network, providing an example with a simple scenario that considers latency and security considerations?
Answer: "The client-server architecture handles multiple requests from multiple clients in a network by using a server to host and manage requests. For example, consider a simple e-commerce website with multiple users accessing it simultaneously. The server, running on a powerful machine, handles requests from clients (browsers) and responds with the requested data. To consider latency and security, the server can be located in a data center with multiple servers, each handling a subset of requests, to reduce latency. The server can also implement encryption and secure authentication protocols to ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access."

Segment Text: 
The World Wide Web was introduced in the early 1990s, revolutionizing how people interact with the Internet.
The Web operates on demand, allowing users to access information and content at any time.
HTTP is the protocol that enables this, allowing clients to request and receive web pages from servers.
The protocol uses TCP for reliable data transfer and is implemented in both client and server programs.
HTTP uses non-persistent connections by default, where each TCP connection is closed after the server sends the object.
This approach generates 11 TCP connections for a single request, with each connection transporting one request and one response message.
The use of parallel connections shortens the response time.
ent, and, finally, the client acknowledges back to the server.
The first two parts of the three-way handshake take one RTT.
After completing the first two parts of the handshake, the client sends the HTTP request message combined with the third part of the three-way handshake
(the acknowledgment) into the TCP connection.
Once the request message arrives at
the server, the server sends the HTML file into the TCP connection.
This HTTP request/response eats up another RTT.
Thus, roughly, the t HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE) are used to interact with web servers.
The GET method retrieves a web page, while the POST method sends data to the server to create a new resource.
The HEAD method is similar to GET, but only returns the headers, and the PUT and DELETE methods are used for uploading and deleting files, respectively.
An HTTP response message consists of a status line, headers, and the entity body, which contains the requested object.

Cookies allow websites to track users and maintain sessions.
A cookie is created by a server, sent to the user's browser, and stored on the user's device.
The user's browser then sends the cookie back to the server with each request, allowing the server to identify the user.
Cookies can be used for authentication, personalization, and tracking user activity.

case of non-persistent connections.
Let¡¯s suppose the page consists of a base HTML
file and 10 JPEG images, until
the entire file is received by the client.
To this end, we define the round-trip time

and then back to the client.
The RTT includes packet-propagation delays, packet
queuing delays in intermediate routers and switches, and packet-processing delays.
(These delays were discussed in Section 1.4.)

a user clicks on a hyperlink.
As shown in Figure 2.7, this causes the browser HTTP request message consists of request line and header lines.
The request line has method field, URL field, and HTTP version field.
Header lines include Host, Connection, User-agent, and Accept-language.
The entity body is used with POST method and contains user input.

Question: What are the key differences between TCP and UDP protocols in terms of connection establishment and error handling? Provide a specific example to illustrate how TCP handles packet loss, in contrast to UDP's best-effort delivery approach.
Answer: "TCP and UDP differ in connection establishment and error handling. TCP establishes a connection before transferring data and provides error checking, while UDP does not establish a connection and relies on best-effort delivery. For example, if a TCP packet is lost, it will be retransmitted until it reaches the receiver. In contrast, UDP's best-effort delivery approach means that lost packets are not retransmitted, and the receiving end may receive packets out of order or in a different sequence."

Objective: Understand TCP congestion control
Segment Text: 
• TCP congestion control is a mechanism that prevents network congestion by regulating the rate at which data is sent.
• It slows down the sender when the network is congested and speeds up the sender when the network is not congested.
• TCP uses a congestion control algorithm to determine the optimal rate at which to send data.
• The algorithm takes into account the current network conditions, such as the number of packets in flight and the round-trip time, to determine the optimal rate.
• TCP also uses a mechanism called slow-start to slow down the sender when the network is congested.
• Slow-start involves doubling the sender rate every round-trip time until the sender reaches a maximum rate.
• This allows TCP to gradually increase the sender rate and prevent congestion.
• In contrast, UDP traffic is unregulated and can be sent at any rate.
• The lack of congestion control in UDP can lead to network congestion and packet loss.

It iteratively updates the shortest paths from the source node to all nodes in the network, where the number of iterations is equal to the number of nodes in the network. The algorithm consists of an initialization step followed by a loop that finds the node with the minimum cost, adds it to the set of known shortest paths, and updates the costs to its neighbors. The algorithm terminates when all nodes are included in the set of known shortest paths, resulting in a table of shortest paths from the source node to all nodes in the network. The LS algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O(n^2) due to its iterative process of finding the least-cost path from a node to all destinations.

A graph is used to formulate routing problems, where nodes represent routers and edges represent physical links. Edge costs reflect the cost of the link, which can be physical length, link speed, or monetary cost. The goal is to find the least costly path between sources and destinations. Least-Cost Path Problem: Find the path with the least cost between source and destination nodes. Centralized routing algorithms use complete network information. Decentralized routing algorithms use iterative, distributed methods. Algorithms can be classified into global state (link-state) and local state (distance-vector) based on their operation. Routing algorithms can be static, dynamic, or load-sensitive. Static algorithms change slowly, while dynamic algorithms change in response to network changes. Load-sensitive algorithms reflect current congestion levels, while load-insensitive algorithms do not. The link-state routing algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, computes least-cost paths from a source node to all other nodes in the network.

Question: How does a directed graph used to model the network topology affect the performance of routing algorithms in finding the least costly path between senders and receivers in a network?
Answer: "A directed graph is used to model the network topology, which affects the performance of routing algorithms by allowing them to find the least costly path between senders and receivers in a network. The graph represents nodes as routers and edges as physical links, with edge costs reflecting the cost of the link. Routing algorithms use this graph to determine the least costly path, and can be classified into global state and local state algorithms.

Please provide a concrete example of a live event and describe the impact on data transmission rate when the signal strength is reduced to 50% of its original value.
Answer: "In a live event scenario, such as a music festival, a wireless network is used to transmit data between the stage, sound systems, and audience devices. The decreasing signal strength would significantly affect the data transmission rate.When the signal strength is reduced to 50% of its original value, the data transmission rate would decrease by approximately 50%. This is because the signal strength directly affects the quality of the data transmission, and a weaker signal would result in more errors and packet loss. As a result, the data transmission rate would slow down, causing delays and disruptions in the live event. For example, if the stage is 100 meters away from the audience, and the signal strength is reduced to 50%, the data transmission rate would decrease from 100 Mbps to 50 Mbps, resulting in a significant delay in the transmission of audio and video signals. This would negatively impact the overall quality of the live event, causing delays and disruptions in the audio and video playback."

To forward data to the mobile host uninterrupted, the network uses techniques such as location-based forwarding, which relies on the location of the mobile host. The location can be determined using various methods, including cellular triangulation, GPS, and Wi-Fi-based locationing. Once the location is determined, the network can use routing protocols to forward data to the mobile host. Additionally, the network can use techniques such as adaptive routing and handoff protocols to ensure that data is delivered to the mobile host in a timely manner.

In 802.11, each wireless station needs to associate with an AP before it can send or receive network-layer data. Although all of the 802.11 standards use association, we¡¯ll discuss this topic specifically in the context of IEEE 802.11b/g. When a network administrator installs an AP, the administrator assigns a one- or two-word Service Set ID to the probe request frame with a probe response frame. The wireless device can then choose the AP with which to associate from among the responding APs. After selecting the AP with which to associate, the wireless device sends an association request frame to the AP, and the AP responds with an association response frame. Note that this second request/response handshake is needed with active scan
ning, since an AP responding to the initial probe request frame doesn¡¯t know which AP to associate with. The 802.11 uses link-layer acknowledgments and CSMA/CA protocol to reduce collisions in wireless LANs. The protocol uses a backoff period to avoid simultaneous transmission, and if a collision occurs, the transmitting station retransmits the frame. The goal is to avoid collisions whenever possible, and the protocol uses random backoff to minimize the chance of simultaneous transmission. The 802.11 MAC protocol includes a reservation scheme that helps avoid collisions even in the presence of hidden terminals. RTS (Request to Send) and CTS (Clear to Send) frames are used to reserve the channel, allowing a station to send a long DATA frame without collisions. This improves performance by mitigating the hidden terminal problem and reducing channel collisions. However, it also introduces delay and consumes channel resources.

Objective: Learn about the types of ciphers and their characteristics
Segment Text: 
Monoalphabetic ciphers use a single substitution rule to encode each letter, but can be broken using statistical analysis or brute-force methods. Polyalphabetic ciphers use multiple substitution rules to encode letters in specific positions, making them more secure. Stream ciphers encrypt data in real-time, while block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks of data. Block ciphers divide messages into k-bit blocks and encrypt each block independently using a one-to-one map. The number of possible mappings is 2k!, making brute-force attacks feasible for small k values. To thwart brute-force attacks, block ciphers use functions that simulate randomly permuted tables, rather than full tables. Examples include DES, 3DES, and AES, which use functions and keys to determine specific "mini-table" mappings and permutations. Block ciphers introduce randomness to ciphertext to prevent identical plaintext blocks from producing identical ciphertext blocks. CBC adds an Initialization Vector (IV) to the first block, which is sent in cleartext, to enable the receiver to recover the original message and to make identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertext blocks.

Buffer depletion rate is x, and arrival rate is x-r.
When buffer is full, playback freezes until the next refill.
Repositioning and early termination waste bandwidth and server resources.
DASH uses multiple compressed video versions to adapt to changing network conditions.

Question: What would be the impact on the streaming system's performance when a 30-second period of paused video playback is added to a scenario with a buffer depletion rate of 10% and an arrival rate of 5%?
Answer: The impact on the streaming system's performance when a 30-second period of paused video playback is added to a scenario with a buffer depletion rate of 10% and an arrival rate of 5% would likely result in repositioning and early termination of the playback, wasting bandwidth and server resources.

Objective: Understand the buffering mechanism in video streaming
Segment Text: 
• Streaming video systems use client-side buffering to mitigate delays and bandwidth issues.
• Client buffering allows clients to absorb variations in server-to-client delay and continue playback even with reduced bandwidth.
• The client builds up a reserve of video in an application buffer before starting playback, enabling uninterrupted playback.
• deo con
sumption rate by clocking out the video chunks over UDP at a steady rate.
• For exam
ple, if the video consumption rate is 2 Mbps and each UDP packet carries 8,000
bits of video, then the server would transmit one UDP packet into its socket every
(8000 bits)/(2 Mbps) = 4 msec.

Segment Text: 
• Streaming video involves pre-recording and storing videos on servers for on-demand viewing.
• Client-side buffering is used to mitigate delays and bandwidth issues.
• The client builds up a reserve of video data before playing it out, absorbing variations in server-to-client delay and bandwidth drops.
• the client begins playout, each block should be played out
time units after the previous block in order to reproduce the timing of the original
recorded video.
• Because of the variable end-to-end network delays, different video blocks experience different delays.
• The first video block arrives at the client at t1 and
the second block arrives at t2.
• The network delay for the ith block is the horizontal distance between the time the block was transmitted by the server and the time it is

Question: Can you explain how client-side buffering helps mitigate delays and bandwidth issues in streaming video, using a specific example to illustrate the concept?
Answer: "Client-side buffering helps mitigate delays and bandwidth issues in streaming video by storing a reserve of video data at the client's end before playing it out. This allows the client to absorb variations in server-to-client delay and bandwidth drops, ensuring a smoother playback experience. For example, let's say a video is transmitted in blocks, with each block arriving at the client at different times due to variable network delays. The client builds up a reserve of video data before playing out each block, allowing it to reproduce the timing of the original recorded video. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the network delay for the ith block is the horizontal distance between the time the block was transmitted by the server and the time it is received at the client, as is the case with Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [RFC 2326]."

Question: Given a video streaming system with a client-side buffer size of 10 seconds, determine the maximum time delay between the transmission of the first and second video blocks, considering the variable network delay and the effect of client-side buffering on the playback timing.
Answer: "The maximum time delay between the transmission of the first and second video blocks is determined by the client-side buffer size, which is 10 seconds. This is because the client can continue playback as long as the buffer isn't drained. Therefore, the maximum delay is 10 seconds."
