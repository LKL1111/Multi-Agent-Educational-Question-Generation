Segment:
A router is a device that forwards packets of data between computer networks. Routers are connected to at least two networks, and they use headers and forwarding tables to determine the next hop for each packet. They can be thought of as the "traffic cops" of the internet, directing data packets along the most efficient path to their destination.
Answer: "A router's primary function is to forward packets of data between computer networks, directing them along the most efficient path to their destination."
Question: What is the purpose of a subnet mask?
Segment:
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to identify the network and host parts of an IP address. It is used in conjunction with the IP address to determine which part of the address refers to the network and which part refers to the host. The subnet mask is used to perform the logical AND operation on the IP address and the subnet mask to determine the network ID and host ID.
Answer: "The purpose of a subnet mask is to identify the network and host parts of an IP address, used in conjunction with the IP address to determine the network ID and host ID."
9
Objective: Understand the characteristics of physical media
Segment Text:
In order to define what is meant by a physical medium, let us reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end system. This poor bit gets kicked around and transmitted many, many times! The source end system first transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the first router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the second router receives the bit; and so on.
Keywords: ['physical media', 'characteristics', 'bit', 'transmission', 'router']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How does a bit travel from one end system to another through a series of links and routers, and what specific events occur at each step in this process?

The general structure of an HTTP response message follows the format of a request message, but it starts with a status line that includes the HTTP version, a status code, and a reason phrase."
15
Objective: Understand the concept of cookies
Segment Text:
• HTTP is stateless, which simplifies server design and allows Web servers to handle thousands of simultaneous TCP connections.
• However, it is often desirable for a Web site to identify users, either for restricting access or for serving content based on user identity.
• For these purposes, HTTP uses cookies.
Keywords: ['cookies', 'HTTP', 'server', 'stateless', 'user', 'access']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How do HTTP servers use cookies to facilitate user identification and access control despite their stateless nature?
Answer: "HTTP servers use cookies to facilitate user identification and access control by storing user data on the client-side and retrieving it on subsequent requests."

Objective: Learn how to implement the forwarding function in a router
Segment Text: 
• A router’s input ports, output ports, and switching fabric are almost always
implemented in hardware, as shown in Figure 4.4. To appreciate why a hardware
implementation is needed, consider that with a 10 Gbps input link and a 64-byte IP
datagram, the input port has only 51.2 ns to process the datagram before another
datagram may arrive. If N ports are combined on a line card (as is often done in
practice), the datagram-processing pipeline must operate N times faster¡ªfar too
fast for software implementation. Forwarding hardware can be implemented either
using a router vendor’s own hardware designs, or constructed using purchased
merchant-silicon chips (e.g., as sold by companies such as Intel and Broadcom).
• The lookup performed in the input port is central to the router’s operation¡ªit is here
that the router uses the forwarding table to look up the output port to which an arriving
packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric. The forwarding table is either computed
and updated by the routing processor (using a routing protocol to interact with the routing
processors in other network routers) or is received from a remote SDN controller.
Keywords: ['forwarding function', 'hardware implementation', 'forwarding table', 'routing processor']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: The forwarding function for a router with 8 input ports, each capable of handling 10 Gbps, should be implemented in hardware. Considering a 64-byte IP datagram arriving at each port simultaneously, what is the minimum processing speed required for the forwarding hardware to handle all datagrams before the next set arrives?
Answer: "51.2 ns"

44
Objective: Learn about routing algorithms and their classification
Segment Text: 
• In this chapter, we’ll study how those forwarding and flow tables are computed,
maintained and installed. In our introduction to the network layer in Section 4.1, we
learned that there are two possible approaches for doing so.
• Per-router control. Figure 5.1 illustrates the case where a routing algorithm runs
in each and every router; both a forwarding and a routing function are contained
within each router. Each router has a routing component that communicates with
the routing components in other routers to compute the values for its forwarding
table. This per-router control approach has been used in the Internet for decades.
The OSPF and BGP protocols that we’ll study in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 are based
on this per-router approach to control.
• Logically centralized control. Figure 5.2 illustrates the case in which a logically
centralized controller computes and distributes the forwarding tables to be used
by each and every router. As we saw in Section 4.4, the  generalized match-plus
action abstraction allows the router to perform traditional IP forwarding as well
as a rich set of other functions (load sharing, firewalling, and NAT) that had been
previously implemented in separate middleboxes.
Keywords: ['routing algorithms', 'per-router control', 'logically centralized control', 'forwarding table', 'generalized match-plus-action abstraction']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How do the per-router control and logically centralized control approaches in routing algorithms differ in terms of scalability, efficiency, and ease of implementation?
Answer: "The per-router control approach involves running a routing algorithm in each router, with each router computing its own forwarding table through communication with other routers. In contrast, logically centralized control involves a centralized controller computing and distributing forwarding tables to all routers."

Objective: Understand the Link Layer and its role in the OSI Model
Segment Text: 
Let’s begin with some important terminology. We’ll find it convenient in this chapter
to refer to any device that runs a link-layer (i.e., layer 2) protocol as a node. Nodes
include hosts, routers, switches, and WiFi access points (discussed in Chapter 7). We
will also refer to the communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along the
communication path as links. In order for a datagram to be transferred from source host
to destination host, it must be moved over each of the individual links in the end-to
end path.
Keywords: ['link layer', 'OSI model', 'nodes', 'links', 'datagram']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What specific role does the Link Layer play in facilitating communication between nodes in the OSI Model, and how does it enable the transfer of datagrams over individual links in the end-to-end path?
Answer: "The Link Layer facilitates communication between nodes in the OSI Model by enabling the transfer of datagrams over individual links in the end-to-end path."
52
Objective: Learn about the services provided by the Link Layer
Segment Text: 
Although the basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node
to an adjacent node over a single communication link, the details of the provided
service can vary from one link-layer protocol to the next. Possible services that can
be offered by a link-layer protocol include:
• Framing. Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer data
gram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link.
• Link access. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by
which a frame is transmitted onto the link.
• Reliable delivery. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service,
it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error.
• Error detection and correction. The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can incor
rectly decide that a bit in a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one, and vice
versa.
Keywords: ['link layer', 'services', 'framing', 'link access', 'reliable delivery', 'error detection', 'correction']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How do the various link-layer services, such as framing, link access, reliable delivery, and error detection/correction, contribute to the overall efficiency and reliability of data transmission in a network?
Answer: "The various link-layer services, such as framing, link access, reliable delivery, and error detection/correction, contribute to the overall efficiency and reliability of data transmission in a network by providing a reliable and error-free transfer of data across the link."
53
Objective: Understand the implementation of the Link Layer
Segment Text: 
The link layer is implemented in a network adapter, also sometimes known as a network
interface card (NIC). At the heart of the network adapter is the link-layer controller,
usually a single, special-purpose chip that implements many of the link-layer services
(framing, link access, error detection, and so on). Thus, much of a link-layer controller’s
functionality is implemented in hardware. For example, Intel’s 710 adapter [Intel
2016] implements the Ethernet protocols we’ll study in Section 6.5; the Atheros
AR5006 [Atheros 2016] controller implements the 802.11 WiFi protocols we’ll
study in Chapter 7.
Keywords: ['link layer', 'implementation', 'network adapter', 'link-layer controller', 'hardware']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How is the link layer implemented in a network adapter, specifically focusing on the interplay between hardware and software components?
Answer: "The link layer is implemented in a network adapter's link-layer controller, which is usually a single chip that implements many of the link-layer services in hardware."
54
Objective: Learn about error-detection and -correction techniques
Segment Text: 
In the previous section, we noted that bit-level error detection and correction—
detecting and correcting the corruption of bits in a link-layer frame sent from one
node to another physically connected neighboring node—are two services often
provided by the link layer. We’ll examine a few of the simplest techniques that can
be used to detect and, in some cases, correct such bit errors. A full treatment of the
theory and implementation of this topic is itself the topic of many textbooks (for
example, [Schwartz 1980] or [Bertsekas 1991]), and our treatment here is necessarily
brief.
Keywords: ['error detection', 'correction', 'link layer', 'techniques']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How do the two main link layer services related to error handling differ between error detection and correction?
Answer: "Error detection involves identifying that a bit error has occurred, whereas error correction involves not only detecting but also correcting the bit error."

• Although the basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node
to an adjacent node over a single communication link, the details of the provided
service can vary from one link-layer protocol to the next. Possible services that can
be offered by a link-layer protocol include:
• Framing. Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer data
gram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link. A frame consists
of a data field, in which the network-layer datagram is inserted, and a number of
header fields. The structure of the frame is specified by the link-layer protocol.
• Link access. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by
which a frame is transmitted onto the link. For point-to-point links that have a
single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the
link, the MAC protocol is simple (or nonexistent)—the sender can send a frame
whenever the link is idle. The more interesting case is when multiple nodes share
a single broadcast link—the so-called multiple access problem. Here, the MAC
protocol serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes.
• Reliable delivery. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service,
it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error.
• Error detection and correction. The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can incor
rectly decide that a bit in a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one, and vice
versa. Such bit errors are introduced by signal attenuation and electromagnetic noise.

Chapter 6 - Subchapter 2 
56
Objective: Understand the multiple access problem and its significance in network links
Segment Text: 
• In the introduction to this chapter, we noted that there are two types of network links:
point-to-point links and broadcast links. A point-to-point link consists of a single
sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link. Many
link-layer protocols have been designed for point-to-point links; the point-to-point
protocol (PPP) and high-level data link control (HDLC) are two such protocols. The
second type of link, a broadcast link, can have multiple sending and receiving nodes
all connected to the same, single, shared broadcast channel. The term broadcast is
used here because when any one node transmits a frame, the channel broadcasts the
frame and each of the other nodes receives a copy. Ethernet and wireless LANs are
examples of broadcast link-layer technologies.
Keywords: ['multiple access', 'point-to-point', 'broadcast', 'link-layer', 'protocols']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How does the concept of multiple access in point-to-point versus broadcast links impact the design and operation of link-layer protocols?
Answer: "The concept of multiple access in point-to-point versus broadcast links impacts the design and operation of link-layer protocols by determining the number of nodes that can transmit and receive data on the link, with point-to-point links having a single sender and receiver and broadcast links having multiple nodes connected to a shared channel."
57
Objective: Learn how to classify multiple access protocols into three categories: channel partitioning, random access, and taking-turns protocols
Segment Text: 
• Over the years, dozens of multiple access protocols have been implemented in
a variety of link-layer technologies. Nevertheless, we can classify just about any
multiple access protocol as belonging to one of three categories: channel partition
ing protocols, random access protocols, and taking-turns protocols. We¡¯ll cover
these categories of multiple access protocols in the following three subsections.
Keywords: ['multiple access', 'protocols', 'channel partitioning', 'random access', 'taking-turns']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What specific differences between channel partitioning, random access, and taking-turns protocols can be illustrated through the use of real-world scenarios or examples?
Answer: "Channel partitioning protocols divide the channel into separate time slots or frequencies for each user, random access protocols allow users to transmit at any time, and taking-turns protocols have users take turns transmitting in a predetermined order."
58
Objective: Understand the characteristics of a good multiple access protocol
Segment Text: 
• Ideally, a multiple access protocol for a broadcast channel of rate R bits per second
should have the following desirable characteristics:
1. When only one node has data to send, that node has a throughput of R bps.
2. When M nodes have data to send, each of these nodes has a throughput of R/M
bps. This need not necessarily imply that each of the M nodes always has an
instantaneous rate of R/M, but rather that each node should have an average
transmission rate of R/M over some suitably defined interval of time.
3. The protocol is decentralized; that is, there is no master node that represents a
single point of failure for the network.
4. The protocol is simple, so that it is inexpensive to implement.
Keywords: ['multiple access', 'protocol', 'characteristics', 'throughput', 'decentralization', 'simplicity']

59
Objective: Learn about the multiple access problem and its importance in network design
Segment Text: 
• Because all nodes are capable of transmitting frames, more than two nodes can
transmit frames at the same time. When this happens, all of the nodes receive multiple
frames at the same time; that is, the transmitted frames collide at all of the receivers.
• Typically, when there is a collision, none of the receiving nodes can make any
sense of any of the frames that were transmitted; in a sense, the signals of the colliding
frames become inextricably tangled together.
Keywords: ['multiple access problem', 'collision', 'frames', 'nodes']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: In a network with 5 nodes transmitting frames simultaneously, what happens when varying frame lengths are involved and how do different collision detection methods impact the outcome of the collision?
Answer: "When varying frame lengths are involved in a network with 5 nodes transmitting frames simultaneously, collisions can occur, causing the frames to become tangled together and making it difficult for receiving nodes to interpret the signals. Different collision detection methods, such as CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) and CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance), can impact the outcome of the collision by either detecting the collision and retransmitting the frames or avoiding collisions altogether by sensing the network before transmitting."

a signal (the code) that changes at a much faster rate (known as the chipping rate)
than the original sequence of data bits.

Objective: Understand the concept of network security and its importance
Segment Text: 
• Let’s begin our study of network security by returning to our lovers, Alice and Bob,
who want to communicate “securely.” What precisely does this mean? Certainly,
Alice wants only Bob to be able to understand a message that she has sent, even
though they are communicating over an insecure medium where an intruder (Trudy,
the intruder) may intercept whatever is transmitted from Alice to Bob. Bob also
wants to be sure that the message he receives from Alice was indeed sent by Alice,
and Alice wants to make sure that the person with whom she is communicating is
indeed Bob. Alice and Bob also want to make sure that the contents of their messages
have not been altered in transit. They also want to be assured that they can communi
cate in the first place (i.e., that no one denies them access to the resources needed to
communicate). Given these considerations, we can identify the following desirable
properties of secure communication.
Keywords: ['network security', 'secure communication', 'confidentiality', 'message integrity', 'end-point authentication', 'operational security']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: In the context of Alice and Bob's communication, what are the desirable properties of secure communication as identified by them?
Answer: "Alice and Bob desire secure communication to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and availability of their messages."
72
Objective: Learn about the desirable properties of secure communication
Segment Text: 
• Having established what we mean by network security, let’s next consider
exactly what information an intruder may have access to, and what actions can be
taken by the intruder. Figure 8.1 illustrates the scenario. Alice, the sender, wants to
send data to Bob, the receiver. In order to exchange data securely, while meeting
the requirements of confidentiality, end-point authentication, and message integrity,
Alice and Bob will exchange control messages and data messages (in much the same
way that TCP senders and receivers exchange control segments and data segments).

Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: How does the exchange of control messages and data messages between Alice and Bob contribute to achieving confidentiality, end-point authentication, and message integrity in a secure communication scenario?
Answer: "Control messages and data messages exchanged between Alice and Bob allow for confidentiality, end-point authentication, and message integrity by enabling secure communication."
73
Objective: Understand the concepts of confidentiality, message integrity, end-point authentication, and operational security
Segment Text: 
• Having established the framework, a few of the most important definitions,
and the need for network security, let’s next consider exactly what information an
intruder may have access to, and what actions can be taken by the intruder.
• Confidentiality. Only the sender and intended receiver should be able to under
stand the contents of the transmitted message. Because eavesdroppers may
intercept the message, this necessarily requires that the message be somehow
encrypted so that an intercepted message cannot be understood by an interceptor.
• Message integrity. Alice and Bob want to ensure that the content of their
communication is not altered, either maliciously or by accident, in transit. Exten
sions to the checksumming techniques that we encountered in reliable transport
and data link protocols can be used to provide such message integrity.
• End-point authentication. Both the sender and receiver should be able to confirm
the identity of the other party involved in the communication—to confirm that the
other party is indeed who or what they claim to be. Face-to-face human commu
nication solves this problem easily by visual recognition. When communicating
entities exchange messages over a medium where they cannot see the other party,
authentication is not so simple. When a user wants to access an inbox, how does
the mail server verify that the user is the person he or she claims to be?
• Operational security. Almost all organizations (companies, universities, and so
on) today have networks that are attached to the public Internet. These networks
therefore can potentially be compromised. Attackers can attempt to deposit worms
into the hosts in the network, obtain corporate secrets, map the internal network
configurations, and launch DoS attacks. We’ll see in Section 8.9 that operational
devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems are used to counter
attacks against an organization’s network. A firewall sits between the organiza
tion’s network and the public network, controlling packet access to and from
the network. An intrusion detection system performs “deep packet  inspection,”
alerting the network administrators about suspicious activity.

Objective: Learn how to implement RSA encryption
Segment Text: 
• To generate the public and private RSA keys, Bob performs the following steps:
• 1. Choose two large prime numbers, p and q. How large should p and q be? The
larger the values, the more difficult it is to break RSA, but the longer it takes
to perform the encoding and decoding.
• 2. Compute n = pq and z = (p - 1)(q - 1).
• 3. Choose a number, e, less than n, that has no common factors (other than 1)
with z.
• 4. Find a number, d, such that ed - 1 is exactly divisible (that is, with no  remainder)
by z.
• 5. The public key that Bob makes available to the world, K+ B, is the pair of num
bers (n, e); his private key, K-B, is the pair of numbers (n, d).
Keywords: ['RSA encryption', 'public key', 'private key', 'prime numbers']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: How does the relationship between e and d, as well as the role of z, contribute to the security of the RSA encryption process, and how can z be used to find the value of d such that ed - 1 is exactly divisible by z?
Answer: "The relationship between e and d, as well as the role of z, contributes to the security of the RSA encryption process by ensuring that the public key (e) and private key (d) are mathematically related, and that d is chosen such that ed - 1 is exactly divisible by z. This relationship is crucial for the decryption process, as it allows Bob to recover the original message. z is used to find the value of d by ensuring that d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo z, which is a necessary condition for the decryption process to work correctly."
