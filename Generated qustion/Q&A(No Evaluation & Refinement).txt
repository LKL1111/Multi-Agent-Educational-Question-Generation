Objective: Understand the evolution of the Internet and the role of the Web
Segment Text: 
Until the early 1990s the Internet was used primarily by researchers, academics,
and university students to log in to remote hosts, to transfer files from local hosts
to remote hosts and vice versa, to receive and send news, and to receive and send
electronic mail. Although these applications were (and continue to be) extremely
useful, the Internet was essentially unknown outside of the academic and research
communities. Then, in the early 1990s, a major new application arrived on the
scene¡ªthe World Wide Web [Berners-Lee 1994]. The Web was the first Internet
application that caught the general public¡¯s eye. It dramatically changed, and con
tinues to change, how people interact inside and outside their work environments.

Objective: Learn about the features and benefits of the Web
Segment Text: 
Perhaps what appeals the most to users is that the Web operates on demand.
Users receive what they want, when they want it. This is unlike traditional broadcast
radio and television, which force users to tune in when the content provider makes
the content available. In addition to being available on demand, the Web has many
other wonderful features that people love and cherish. It is enormously easy for any
individual to make information available over the Web¡ªeveryone can become a
publisher at extremely low cost. Hyperlinks and search engines help us navigate
through an ocean of information. Photos and videos stimulate our senses. Forms,
JavaScript, Java applets, and many other devices enable us to interact with pages and
sites. And the Web and its protocols serve as a platform for YouTube, Web-based
e-mail (such as Gmail), and most mobile Internet applications, including Instagram
and Google Maps.

Segment Text: 
• A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication between
application processes running on different hosts.
• By logical communication, we mean that from an application’s perspective,
it is as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected; in reality,
the hosts may be on opposite sides of the planet, connected via numerous
routers and a wide range of link types.
• Application processes use the logical communication provided by the trans
port layer to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details
of the physical infrastructure used to carry these messages.

Objective: Understand transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing
Segment Text: 
• At the destination host, the transport layer receives segments from the network
layer just below. The transport layer has the responsibility of delivering the data in
these segments to the appropriate application process running in the host.
• The transport layer in the receiving host does not actually deliver data directly to
a process, but instead to an intermediary socket. Because at any given time there can
be more than one socket in the receiving host, each socket has a unique identifier.
• Each transport-layer segment has a set of fields in the segment for this purpose.

Segment Text: 
• The transport layer receives segments from the network layer just below.
• The transport layer has the responsibility of delivering the data in these seg
ments to the appropriate application process running in the host.
• Let’s take a look at an example. Suppose you are sitting in front of your com
puter, and you are downloading Web pages while running one FTP session
and two Telnet sessions. You therefore have four network application pro
cesses running—two Telnet processes, one FTP process, and one HTTP pro
cess.
Keywords: ['transport layer', 'segments', 'application processes', 'host']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: Consider a scenario where you have four network application processes running on your computer: two Telnet sessions, one FTP session, and one HTTP session. Explain how the transport layer multiplexes and demultiplexes data for these different application processes.
Answer: "The transport layer multiplexes data by assigning a unique port number to each application process, allowing multiple processes to share the same connection. It demultiplexes data by checking the destination port number in the segment header, directing the data to the correct application process."
24
Objective: Understand the role of the transport layer in the Internet
Segment Text: 
In the previous two chapters we touched on the role of the transport layer and the services that it provides. Let’s quickly review what we have already learned about the transport layer.
A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication between application processes running on different hosts. By logical communication, we mean that from an application’s perspective, it is as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected; in reality, the hosts may be on opposite sides of the planet, connected via numerous routers and a wide range of link types.
Application processes use the logical communication provided by the transport layer to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details of the physical infrastructure used to carry these messages. Figure 3.1 illustrates the notion of logical communication.
Keywords: ['transport layer', 'logical communication', 'application processes', 'hosts', 'network infrastructure']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: Explain the concept of logical communication in the context of the transport layer.
Answer: "The transport layer provides logical communication between application processes running on different hosts, allowing them to send messages as if they were directly connected."
25
Objective: Understand the relationship between the transport layer and the network layer
Segment Text: 
Recall that the transport layer lies just above the network layer in the protocol stack. Whereas a transport-layer protocol provides logical communication between processes running on different hosts, a network-layer protocol provides logical-communication between hosts. This distinction is subtle but important.
Let’s examine this distinction with the aid of a household analogy.
Consider two houses, one on the East Coast and the other on the West Coast, with each house being home to a dozen kids. The kids in the East Coast household are cousins of the kids in the West Coast household.
Keywords: ['transport layer', 'network layer', 'protocol stack', 'logical communication', 'hosts', 'household analogy']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: Suppose you are the network administrator for a household with two houses, one on the East Coast and the other on the West Coast, and you need to ensure that data packets are delivered between the kids in these two households. Describe how you would use the network layer to set up the necessary logical communication between these two households.
Answer: "To set up logical communication between the two households, I would use the network layer to create a logical connection between the two houses, essentially creating a virtual network link between them. This would involve assigning IP addresses to each house, which would serve as their unique identifiers on the network. The network layer would then use routing protocols to determine the best path for data packets to travel between the two houses, ensuring that they are delivered efficiently and reliably."

Objective: Learn how to implement transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing
Segment Text: 
• The transport layer receives segments from the network layer just below.
• The transport layer has the responsibility of delivering the data in these segments to the appropriate application process running in the host.
• Let¡¯s now examine how this is done.
• First recall from Section 2.7 that a process (as part of a network application)
can have one or more sockets, doors through which data passes from the network to
the process and through which data passes from the process to the network.
Keywords: ['implementation', 'transport-layer', 'multiplexing', 'demultiplexing', 'sockets', 'process']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: Describe a scenario where a process has two sockets, and explain how the transport layer would multiplex and demultiplex data between these sockets.
Answer: "A scenario where a process has two sockets is when a web server is handling multiple client requests simultaneously. The transport layer would multiplex data between these sockets by receiving data from the network layer and directing it to the correct socket based on the destination IP address and port number. Demultiplexing occurs when the transport layer receives data from the socket and directs it to the correct application process running in the host."

Objective: Learn how transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing is implemented in the Internet
Segment Text: 
the segment for this purpose. At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these
fields to identify the receiving socket and then directs the segment to that socket.
This job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is
called demultiplexing. The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from
different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information (that will
later be used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and passing the segments to the
network layer is called multiplexing. Note that the transport layer in the middle host
in Figure 3.2 must demultiplex segments arriving from the network layer below to
either process P1 or P2 above; this is done by directing the arriving segment¡¯s data to
the corresponding process¡¯s socket. The transport layer in the middle host must also
gather outgoing data from these sockets, form transport-layer segments, and pass
these segments down to the network layer.

Question Type: Application Questions
Question: A network host receives a transport-layer segment with the source socket number 1234 and the destination socket number 5678. Explain how the transport layer would demultiplex this segment to the correct socket.
Answer: "The transport layer demultiplexes the segment by examining the destination socket number 5678 and directs the segment to the corresponding socket."
30
Objective: Understand the difference between UDP and TCP multiplexing and demultiplexing
Segment Text: 
One subtle difference between a TCP socket and a UDP socket is that a TCP socket
is identified by a four-tuple: (source IP address, source port number, destination IP
address, destination port number). Thus, when a TCP segment arrives from the network
to a host, the host uses all four values to direct (demultiplex) the segment to the
appropriate socket. In particular, and in contrast with UDP, two arriving TCP segments
with different source IP addresses or source port numbers will (with the exception of a
TCP segment carrying the original connection-establishment request) be directed to two
different sockets.
Keywords: ['TCP', 'UDP', 'socket', 'IP address', 'port number', 'demultiplexing']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: Explain why TCP uses a four-tuple (source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number) for demultiplexing, while UDP uses only a two-tuple (destination IP address, destination port number).
Answer: "TCP uses a four-tuple for demultiplexing because it needs to identify the source of the segment, while UDP uses only a two-tuple because it does not require source identification."

Objective: Understand the difference between forwarding and routing
Segment Text: 
• Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface.

Objective: Understand the architecture of a router
Segment Text: 
• Now that we¡¯ve overviewed the data and control planes within the network layer,
the important distinction between forwarding and routing, and the services and
functions of the network layer, let¡¯s turn our attention to its forwarding function¡ª
the actual transfer of packets from a router¡¯s incoming links to the appropriate
outgoing links at that router.
• A high-level view of a generic router architecture is shown in Figure 4.4. Four
router components can be identified:
•? Input ports. An input port performs several key functions.
•? Switching fabric. The switching fabric connects the router¡¯s input ports to its
output ports.
•? Output ports. An output port stores packets received from the switching fabric
and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary
link-layer and physical-layer functions.
•? Routing processor. The routing processor performs control-plane functions.

37
Objective: Learn about the forwarding process in routers
Segment Text: 
• The lookup performed in the input port is central to the router¡¯s operation¡ªit is
here that the router uses the forwarding table to look up the output port to which
an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric.
• The forwarding table is either computed and updated by the routing processor
(using a routing protocol to interact with the routing processors in other network
routers) or is received from a remote SDN controller.
• The forwarding table is copied from the routing processor to the line cards over
a separate bus (e.g., a PCI bus) indicated by the dashed line from the routing
processor to the input line cards in Figure 4.4.

38
Objective: Understand the queuing and scheduling of packets in routers
Segment Text: 
• If the switch fabric is not fast enough (relative to the input line speeds) to
transfer all arriving packets through the fabric without delay, packet queuing can
also occur at the input ports.
• Packet queues can form at the output ports even when the switching fabric is N
times faster than the port line speeds.
• A packet scheduler at the output port must choose one packet, among those
queued, for transmission.
Keywords: ['queuing', 'scheduling', 'packet queues', 'output ports']

40
Objective: Learn how routers handle packet forwarding and queuing
Segment Text: 
• A packet¡¯s output port has been determined via the lookup, the packet can be sent into the switching fabric.
• The switching fabric is at the very heart of a router, as it is through this fabric that the packets are actually switched (that is, forwarded) from an input port to an output port.
• Packet queues may form at both the input ports and the output ports, just as we identified cases where cars may wait at the inputs and outputs of the traffic intersection in our roundabout analogy.

• Whereas the LS algorithm is an algorithm using global information, the distance
vector (DV) algorithm is iterative, asynchronous, and distributed.
• It is distributed in that each node receives some information from one or more of its
directly attached neighbors, performs a calculation, and then distributes the results of its
calculation back to its neighbors.
• It is iterative in that this process continues on until no more information is exchanged
between neighbors.

detecting and correcting the corruption of bits in a link-layer frame sent from one
node to another physically connected neighboring node—are two services often
provided by the link layer.

to refer to any device that runs a link-layer (i.e., layer 2) protocol as a node. Nodes
include hosts, routers, switches, and WiFi access points (discussed in Chapter 7). We
will also refer to the communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along the
communication path as links.
• In order for a datagram to be transferred from source host to destination host, it must be moved over each of the individual links in the end-to
end path.

53
Objective: Learn about the Services Provided by the Link Layer
Segment Text: 
• Although the basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node
to an adjacent node over a single communication link, the details of the provided
service can vary from one link-layer protocol to the next. Possible services that can
be offered by a link-layer protocol include:
• Framing. Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer data
gram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link.
• Link access. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by
which a frame is transmitted onto the link.
• Reliable delivery. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service,
it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error.

Objective: Understand the concept of multiple access links and protocols
Segment Text: 
• In the introduction to this chapter, we noted that there are two types of network links:
point-to-point links and broadcast links.
• A point-to-point link consists of a single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link.
• Many link-layer protocols have been designed for point-to-point links; the point-to-point
protocol (PPP) and high-level data link control (HDLC) are two such protocols.

57
Objective: Learn about the multiple access problem and its significance
Segment Text: 
• Because all nodes are capable of transmitting frames, more than two nodes can
transmit frames at the same time.
• When this happens, all of the nodes receive multiple frames at the same time; that is, the transmitted frames collide at all of the receivers.
• Typically, when there is a collision, none of the receiving nodes can make any sense of any of the frames that were transmitted; in a sense, the signals of the colliding frames become inextricably tangled together.
Keywords: ['multiple access problem', 'collision', 'broadcast channel']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the outcome when more than two nodes in a broadcast channel transmit frames simultaneously, causing the transmitted frames to collide at all receivers?

munication and mobility.
• We’ll begin by keeping our discussion general enough to cover a wide range of
networks, including both wireless LANs such as IEEE 802.11 and cellular networks
such as a 4G network.
• We can identify the following elements in a wireless network:
• Wireless hosts. As in the case of wired networks, hosts are the end-system devices
that run applications.

• Decreasing signal strength. Electromagnetic radiation attenuates as it passes
through matter (e.g., a radio signal passing through a wall).
• Interference from other sources. Radio sources transmitting in the same frequency
band will interfere with each other.
• Multipath propagation. Multipath propagation occurs when portions of the
electromagnetic wave reflect off objects and the ground, taking paths of different
lengths between a sender and receiver.

Objective: Understand the CDMA protocol
Segment Text: 
• In a CDMA protocol, each bit being sent is encoded by multiplying the bit by
a signal (the code) that changes at a much faster rate (known as the chipping rate)
than the original sequence of data bits.
• Each bit slot is further subdivided into M mini-slots; in Figure 7.5, M = 8,
although in practice M is much larger.
• The CDMA code used by the sender consists of a sequence of M values, cm,
m=1,..., M, each taking a +1 or -1 value.
Keywords: ['CDMA', 'encoding', 'chipping rate', 'mini-slots']
Question Type: Application Questions

Answer: "The chipping rate of the CDMA protocol is 1000 bits per second."
64
Objective: Identify the Challenges of Wireless Communication
Segment Text: 
• Let’s begin by considering a simple wired network, say a home network, with a
wired Ethernet switch (see Section 6.4) interconnecting the hosts.
• If we replace the wired Ethernet with a wireless 802.11 network, a wireless
network interface would replace the host’s wired Ethernet interface, and an access
point would replace the Ethernet switch, but virtually no changes would be needed
at the network layer or above.
• This suggests that we focus our attention on the link layer when looking for
important differences between wired and wireless networks.
• Indeed, we can find a number of important differences between a wired link and
a wireless link:
• Decreasing signal strength. Electromagnetic radiation attenuates as it passes
through matter (e.g., a radio signal passing through a wall).
• Interference from other sources. Radio sources transmitting in the same frequency
band will interfere with each other.
• Multipath propagation. Multipath propagation occurs when portions of the
electromagnetic wave reflect off objects and the ground, taking paths of different
lengths between a sender and receiver.

protocol is needed so that the signals sent by multiple senders do not interfere at
the receivers.

partitioning, random access, and taking turns.
• Code division multiple access (CDMA) belongs to the family of channel partition
ing protocols.
• It is prevalent in wireless LAN and cellular technologies.
• In a CDMA protocol, each bit being sent is encoded by multiplying the bit by a
signal (the code) that changes at a much faster rate (known as the chipping rate)
than the original sequence of data bits.
Keywords: ['CDMA', 'medium access protocols', 'channel partitioning', 'wireless networks']

Pervasive in the workplace, the home, educational institutions, caf¨¦s, airports, and
street corners, wireless LANs are now one of the most important access network
technologies in the Internet today. Although many technologies and standards for
wireless LANs were developed in the 1990s, one particular class of standards has
clearly emerged as the winner: the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN, also known as WiFi.
In this section, we¡¯ll take a close look at 802.11 wireless LANs, examining its frame
structure, its medium access protocol, and its internetworking of 802.11 LANs with
wired Ethernet LANs.

Objective: Learn about the IEEE 802.11 standards and their characteristics
Segment Text: 
There are several 802.11 standards for wireless LAN technology in the IEEE
802.11 (¡°WiFi¡±) family, as summarized in Table 7.1. The different 802.11 standards
all share some common characteristics. They all use the same medium access proto
col, CSMA/CA, which we¡¯ll discuss shortly. All three use the same frame structure
for their link-layer frames as well. All three standards have the ability to reduce
their transmission rate in order to reach out over greater distances. And, importantly,
802.11 products are also all backwards compatible, meaning, for example, that a
mobile capable only of 802.11g may still interact with a newer 802.11ac base station.

Objective: Understand the 802.11 MAC protocol and its collision-avoidance techniques
Segment Text: 
Once a wireless device is associated with an AP, it can start sending and receiving
data frames to and from the access point. But because multiple wireless devices,
or the AP itself may want to transmit data frames at the same time over the same
channel, a multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate the transmissions. In
the following, we'll refer to the devices or the AP as wireless ¡°stations¡± that share
the multiple access channel. As discussed in Chapter 6 and Section 7.2.1, broadly
speaking there are three classes of multiple access protocols: channel partitioning
(including CDMA), random access, and taking turns. Inspired by the huge suc
cess of Ethernet and its random access protocol, the designers of 802.11 chose a
random access protocol for 802.11 wireless LANs. This random access protocol
is referred to as CSMA with collision avoidance, or more succinctly as CSMA/
CA. As with Ethernet¡¯s CSMA/CD, the ¡°CSMA¡± in CSMA/CA stands for ¡°carrier
sense multiple access,¡± meaning that each station senses the channel before trans
mitting, and refrains from transmitting when the channel is sensed busy.
Keywords: ['MAC protocol', 'CSMA/CA', 'collision avoidance', 'carrier sense multiple access']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the primary purpose of the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism in the 802.11 MAC protocol?
Answer: "The primary purpose of the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism in the 802.11 MAC protocol is to coordinate transmissions among multiple wireless devices or the AP, allowing them to sense the channel before transmitting and refrain from transmitting when the channel is busy."

Objective: Understand the concept of network security
Segment Text: 
• Let’s begin our study of network security by returning to our lovers, Alice and Bob,
who want to communicate “securely.” What precisely does this mean?
• Certainly, Alice wants only Bob to be able to understand a message that she has sent,
even though they are communicating over an insecure medium where an intruder
may intercept whatever is transmitted from Alice to Bob.
• Bob also wants to be sure that the message he receives from Alice was indeed sent
by Alice, and Alice wants to make sure that the person with whom she is communicating
is indeed Bob.
Keywords: ['network security', 'secure communication', 'confidentiality', 'integrity', 'authentication']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What does it mean for Alice and Bob to communicate "securely" in the context of network security?
Answer: "Alice and Bob communicate securely if only Bob can understand Alice's message, and Bob is certain that the message he receives was sent by Alice, while Alice is certain that the person she is communicating with is indeed Bob."
72
Objective: Identify the desirable properties of secure communication
Segment Text: 
• Given these considerations, we can identify the following desirable properties of
secure communication.
• • Confidentiality. Only the sender and intended receiver should be able to understand
the contents of the transmitted message.
• • Message integrity. Alice and Bob want to ensure that the content of their
communication is not altered, either maliciously or by accident, in transit.
• • End-point authentication. Both the sender and receiver should be able to confirm
the identity of the other party involved in the communication—to confirm that the
other party is indeed who or what they claim to be.
• • Operational security. Almost all organizations (companies, universities, and so
on) today have networks that are attached to the public Internet. These networks
therefore can potentially be compromised.
Keywords: ['confidentiality', 'message integrity', 'end-point authentication', 'operational security']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the primary goal of operational security in the context of secure communication?
Answer: "Operational security aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communication, particularly in environments where networks are connected to the public Internet."
73
Objective: Understand the framework for network security
Segment Text: 
• Having established what we mean by network security, let’s next consider
exactly what information an intruder may have access to, and what actions can be
taken by the intruder.
• Figure 8.1 illustrates the scenario. Alice, the sender, wants to send data to Bob,
the receiver. In order to exchange data securely, while meeting the requirements of
confidentiality, end-point authentication, and message integrity, Alice and Bob will
exchange control messages and data messages (in much the same way that TCP
senders and receivers exchange control segments and data segments).

are the Internet equivalents of Alice and Bob, our friends who need to communicate
securely?
• Certainly, Bob and Alice might be human users at two end systems, for example,
a real Alice and a real Bob who really do want to exchange secure e-mail. They might
also be participants in an electronic commerce transaction.
Keywords: ['cryptography', 'network security', 'secure communication', 'confidentiality']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: Who are the Internet equivalents of Alice and Bob, and why do they need to communicate securely?
Answer: "Alice and Bob are the Internet equivalents of Alice and Bob, who need to communicate securely to exchange information, such as secure email or electronic commerce transactions."
75
Objective: Understand the principles of cryptography
Segment Text: 
• Cryptographic techniques allow a sender to disguise data so that an intruder can
gain no information from the intercepted data. The receiver, of course, must be able
to recover the original data from the disguised data.
• Suppose now that Alice wants to send a message to Bob. Alice’s message in its
original form (for example, “Bob, I love you. Alice”) is known as plaintext, or cleartext.

76
Objective: Understand the concept of public key encryption
Segment Text: 
• For more than 2,000 years (since the time of the Caesar cipher and up to the 1970s),
encrypted communication required that the two communicating parties share a common secret¡ªthe symmetric key used for encryption and decryption.
• One difficulty with this approach is that the two parties must somehow agree on the shared key;
but to do so requires (presumably secure) communication!
• In 1976, Diffie and Hellman [Diffie 1976] demonstrated an algorithm (known now as Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange) to do just that¡ªa radically different and marvelously elegant approach toward secure communication that has led to the development of today¡¯s public key cryptography systems.
Keywords: ['public key encryption', 'symmetric key', 'Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange', 'public key cryptography']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the fundamental issue with symmetric key encryption that led to the development of public key cryptography?
Answer: "It requires the two parties to share a common secret, which is difficult to agree on securely."
77
Objective: Learn about the use of public key cryptography
Segment Text: 
• Suppose Alice wants to communicate with Bob. As shown in Figure 8.6, rather than Bob and Alice sharing a single secret key (as in the case of symmetric key systems), Bob (the recipient of Alice¡¯s messages) instead has two keys¡ªa public key that is available to everyone in the world (including Trudy the intruder) and a private key that is known only to Bob.
• We will use the notation K+ B and K-B to refer to Bob¡¯s public and private keys, respectively. In order to communicate with Bob, Alice first fetches Bob¡¯s public key. Alice then encrypts her message, m, to Bob using Bob¡¯s public key and a known (for example, standardized) encryption algorithm; that is, Alice computes K+ B(m).

Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the purpose of using a public key and a private key in public key cryptography, as opposed to a single secret key?
Answer: "The purpose of using a public key and a private key in public key cryptography is to enable secure communication between parties without sharing a single secret key, providing an additional layer of security and authenticity."
78
Objective: Understand the RSA algorithm
Segment Text: 
• RSA makes extensive use of arithmetic operations using modulo-n arithmetic.
• So let¡¯s briefly review modular arithmetic. Recall that x mod n simply means the remainder of x when divided by n; so, for example, 19 mod 5 = 4.
Keywords: ['RSA', 'modulo-n arithmetic', 'modular arithmetic']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: Explain the difference between modulo-n arithmetic and modular arithmetic in the context of RSA.
Answer: "Modulo-n arithmetic and modular arithmetic are used interchangeably in the context of RSA, referring to the operation of finding the remainder of a division by a number n."
79
Objective: Learn how to implement the RSA algorithm
Segment Text: 
• To generate the public and private RSA keys, Bob performs the following steps:
1. Choose two large prime numbers, p and q.
2. Compute n = pq and z = (p - 1)(q - 1).
3. Choose a number, e, less than n, that has no common factors (other than 1) with z.
4. Find a number, d, such that ed - 1 is exactly divisible (that is, with no remainder) by z.
Keywords: ['implementation', 'RSA', 'prime numbers', 'modulo-n arithmetic']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: Explain why the choice of e (the public key) must be a number less than n that has no common factors (other than 1) with z.
Answer: "To ensure that the decryption process is reversible, the choice of e must be a number less than n that has no common factors (other than 1) with z."

Objective: Understand the security of RSA
Segment Text: 
• The security of RSA relies on the fact that there are no known algorithms for quickly factoring a number, in this case the public value n, into the primes p and q. If one knew p and q, then given the public value e, one could easily compute the secret key, d.

Objective: Understand the basics of video streaming
Segment Text: 
For streaming video applications, prerecorded videos are placed on servers, and
users send requests to these servers to view the videos on demand. The user may
watch the video from beginning to end without interruption, may stop watching the
video well before it ends, or interact with the video by pausing or repositioning to a
future or past scene.

87
Objective: Learn about the different types of video streaming
Segment Text: 
Streaming video systems can be classified into three categories: UDP streaming,
HTTP streaming, and adaptive HTTP streaming (see Section 2.6). Although all three
types of systems are used in practice, the majority of today¡¯s systems employ HTTP
streaming and adaptive HTTP streaming.

Answer: "UDP streaming, HTTP streaming, and adaptive HTTP streaming."
88
Objective: Understand the client-side buffering in video streaming
Segment Text: 
A common characteristic of all three forms of video streaming is the extensive
use of client-side application buffering to mitigate the effects of varying end-to-end
delays and varying amounts of available bandwidth between server and client. For
streaming video (both stored and live), users generally can tolerate a small several
second initial delay between when the client requests a video and when video playout
begins at the client.
Keywords: ['client-side buffering', 'video streaming', 'end-to-end delays', 'bandwidth', 'client']
Question Type: Conceptual Questions
Question: What is the primary purpose of client-side buffering in video streaming?
Answer: "The primary purpose of client-side buffering in video streaming is to mitigate the effects of varying end-to-end delays and available bandwidth between server and client."
89
Objective: Learn about the HTTP streaming protocol
Segment Text: 
In HTTP streaming, the video is simply stored in an HTTP server as an ordinary
file with a specific URL. When a user wants to see the video, the client establishes
a TCP connection with the server and issues an HTTP GET request for that URL.
The server then sends the video file, within an HTTP response message, as quickly
as possible, that is, as quickly as TCP congestion control and flow control will allow.
On the client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer. Once the
number of bytes in this buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold, the client applica
tion begins playback¡ªspecifically, it periodically grabs video frames from the client
application buffer, decompresses the frames, and displays them on the user¡¯s screen.
Keywords: ['HTTP streaming', 'video file', 'URL', 'TCP connection', 'HTTP GET request', 'client application buffer']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: A client application wants to stream a video file from an HTTP server. If the client's application buffer has 1000 bytes and it grabs 500 bytes at a time for playback, how would you describe the process of video playback in this scenario?
Answer: "The client application periodically grabs 500 bytes from the 1000-byte buffer, decompresses the video frames, and displays them on the user's screen."

Keywords: ['video streaming', 'UDP', 'HTTP', 'adaptive HTTP']
Question Type: Application Questions
Question: Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using UDP streaming versus adaptive HTTP streaming for a video streaming application with varying network bandwidth.
Answer: "UDP streaming is more suitable for applications with low latency requirements and high-bandwidth networks, while adaptive HTTP streaming is better suited for variable network bandwidth and can provide better quality adaptation, but may introduce higher latency."
